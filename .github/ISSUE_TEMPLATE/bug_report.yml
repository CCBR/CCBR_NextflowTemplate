        Please drag and drop any relevant files here. Create a `.zip` archive if the extension is not allowed.
        Your verbose log file `.nextflow.log` is often useful _(this is a hidden file in the directory where you launched the pipeline)_ as well as custom Nextflow configuration files.
        If the bug is related to a GUI, add screenshots to help explain your problem.
